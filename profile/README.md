## ML Materials Standards

This organisation is mostly a vehicle for hosting, sharing and updating the ML Papers Checklist which serves as a guide to authors and reviewers of papers submitted to npj Computational Materials Science.
We welcome community feedback and engagement with this checklist.

Much of this checklist has been adapted from 

[Best practices in machine learning for chemistry](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41557-021-00716-z/MediaObjects/41557_2021_716_MOESM1_ESM.pdf)
